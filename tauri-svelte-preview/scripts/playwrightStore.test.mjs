/**
 * playwrightStore.test.mjs — the /next Playwright card's store, run in plain node.
 *
 * `playwrightStore.svelte.ts` is a runes module, so node cannot import it as it
 * stands: `$state` is compiler syntax, not a function. The test does what vite
 * does — strip the TypeScript types, run the Svelte compiler over the result,
 * and import the compiled JavaScript. The compiled file is written inside
 * `node_modules` so `svelte/internal/client` still resolves, and it is deleted
 * again at the end. Same recipe as `contextStore.test.mjs`.
 *
 * This works only because the store has no runtime imports of its own (its one
 * import is type-only). Keep it that way, or this test has to grow a bundler.
 *
 * What is covered: turning the raw `ps`-shaped rows the desktop app returns into
 * the groups the card shows — one group per process group id, a plain-English
 * name for what each group actually is, and how long it has been running.
