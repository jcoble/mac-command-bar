# The /next component kit

Everything a person clicks in the /next shell comes from this folder. The point
is not that the components exist — it is that a control looks and behaves the
same wherever it turns up. These are the rules that keep that true. Read them
before adding a component or styling a control by hand.

## Where the colors come from

No component in this folder names a color. Each one uses a shadcn slot
(`bg-card`, `text-muted-foreground`, `border-input`, `ring-ring`), and
`src/lib/shell/styles/next.css` points those slots at the shell's own tokens in
`nextTokens.css`. Change the palette there and every control follows.

| What you mean          | What to write                                         |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| The window behind it all | `bg-background`                                     |
| A raised sheet: a card, a panel body | `bg-card`                             |
| A menu, dialog or tooltip | `bg-popover`                                       |
| A quiet filled control, a selected segment | `bg-secondary`                    |
| Hover fill, highlighted menu row | `bg-accent` (this is **not** the brand mint) |
| The mint accent — a send button, a slider's filled track | `bg-primary` |
| Body text / secondary text | `text-foreground` / `text-muted-foreground`      |
| A hairline | `border` with no color, or `ring-1 ring-border`                |

Two tokens the slots have no name for are read directly and only for text
tiers: `var(--color-text-2)` and `var(--color-text-3)`.

`nextTokens.css` is a closed list — a test fails the build if a name is added
to it that no component reads. Reach for an existing token before inventing one.

## Type sizes are not Tailwind's

Inside /next the app's own scale wins: **`text-sm` is 12px and `text-xs` is
11px**, not 14/12. The floor for anything a person reads as content — a menu
row, an option, a field's value, a setting's title — is **13px**, written
`text-[13px]`. Use `text-sm` (12px) for metadata beside it and `text-xs` (11px)
only for a group heading in small caps.

## Shape and spacing

- Radii come from the shell's three-step scale: 8px (`rounded-md`), 12px
  (`rounded-lg`, the default for controls), 16px (`rounded-xl`, for panels and
  the message box). Pills use `rounded-full`.
- Spacing is 4 / 8 / 12 / 16. Inside a control, 8px; between rows, 12px;
  between cards or sections, 16 to 20px.
- Depth is layering, not outlines: a raised surface plus `shadow-sm`, and
  hairlines at low alpha. Do not add a bright border to signal state.

## Every interactive control owes four things

1. **A hit target of at least 24px**, 28px preferred. `Button size="xs"` is 24,
   `sm` is 28, the default is 32. A small target may grow its hit area with an
   invisible `after:absolute after:-inset-2` rather than growing visually.
2. **A visible focus ring**: `focus-visible:ring-ring/50 focus-visible:ring-3`.
   Never `outline: none` without one.
3. **A hover state** — `hover:bg-accent/60 hover:text-foreground` for quiet
   controls; a filled control brightens instead.
4. **A disabled state**: `disabled:opacity-50 disabled:pointer-events-none`,
   and the control must still say why it is off if that is not obvious.

## Which component for which job

| Job | Use |
| --- | --- |
| A command: Send, Done, Reset | `Button` (`default` for the one primary action on screen, `ghost` for everything else) |
| An icon on its own | `IconButton` — it makes the label mandatory and shows it as a tooltip |
| One choice out of 5 or more, or long labels | `Select` (bits-ui). **Never a native `<select>`** — it cannot be styled and comes out as the OS control |
| One choice out of 2–4 short labels worth seeing at once | `SegmentedControl` |
| On or off, taking effect immediately | `Switch` |
| A number on a range | `Slider`, with the value shown beside it |
| Actions, or a setting changed from a compact trigger | `DropdownMenu`, with `Sub` when a row has its own list of values |
| Actions for the row or region under the pointer | `ContextMenu`; attach its trigger only to that target so other native context menus remain available |
| A few icon actions that appear on a list row when it is hovered | `HoverActions` with `HoverActionButton` inside |
| Naming what an icon does | `Tooltip` (already inside `IconButton`) |
| Grouping rows of settings or details | `Card`, or a plain `rounded-xl border` box with rows divided by `border-b` |

## Row actions on hover

Every list row in the app reveals its actions the same way: `HoverActions`
holding two or three `HoverActionButton`s. They are bare icon buttons with
nothing behind them — no pill, no panel, no shadow — sitting over the row's own
metadata, and each one lights up by itself on hover rather than as a block.
They are always in the page and only fade, so revealing them cannot rebuild a
subtree or shift the row's text; the row supplies the trigger by carrying
`class="group"`. A button's `tone` names where the action leads (`primary` for
the session, `info` for a file or editor surface, `success` for source control)
rather than naming a color, and `info` and `success` are the one place a kit
component reads the shell's status tokens directly, because the registry has no
slot for either idea.

## Divergences from the shadcn registry, and why

Vendored components stay verbatim where they can, so the next copy from the
registry is a clean paste. These are the deliberate exceptions:

- `dropdown-menu-item`, `dropdown-menu-sub-trigger`, `context-menu-item`, `select-item`: 13px text
  and `min-h-6`, per the floor and hit-target rules above. Menu rows also style
  `data-highlighted` alongside `focus:`, because keyboard movement through a
  bits-ui menu marks the row rather than focusing it.
- `input`: 13px, and the registry's `text-base md:text-sm` pair is dropped —
  this app has one size.
- `slider`: the thumb took a literal white; it now uses `bg-foreground` so a
  theme change carries it, at 14px with a 28px grab area.
- `tooltip-content`: the registry inverts the tooltip (light on dark-ish). In a
  dark shell that reads as an alarm, so it sits on `bg-popover` with a hairline
  ring and the standard shadow.
- `segmented-control` and `icon-button` are ours; the registry has neither.

## One more trap worth knowing

The vendored components were written against a newer bits-ui than this app
pins. The newer one writes `data-checked`; the pinned one writes
`data-state="checked"`. `next.css` redefines five variants
(`data-checked`, `data-unchecked`, `data-active`, `data-open`, `data-closed`)
so both spellings work, and `scripts/nextTokens.test.mjs` fails on any other
bare `data-…:` class that matches nothing. If you vendor a new component, run
that test before trusting its states.
