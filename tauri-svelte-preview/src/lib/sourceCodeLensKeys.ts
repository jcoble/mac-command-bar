/**
 * sourceCodeLensKeys.ts — the two names behind the "N references" number that
 * Monaco draws above a symbol.
 *
 * There are two of them and they are easy to confuse:
 *
 *  - the **lens id**, which is how Monaco decides whether the lens it is
 *    looking at is the same one it saw a moment ago, and which also carries the
 *    spot back to us when the user clicks the number; and
 *  - the **count key**, which is how the editor remembers a number it has
 *    already been given.
 *
 * Neither may contain the model's version number. It used to, and the effect
 * was that a single keystroke gave every lens on screen a new identity and a
 * new question to ask, all at once. The number counts the symbol's name across
 * the project's saved files, which typing in the open buffer does not change,
 * so where the symbol sits is identity enough and an old number is simply let
 * go after a while.
 *
 * Kept out of `MonacoSourceEditor.svelte` so these rules can be tested without
 * a browser or a Monaco instance.
