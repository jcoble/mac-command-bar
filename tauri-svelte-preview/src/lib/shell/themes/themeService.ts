/**
 * themeService.ts — picking a theme, and making the whole app follow it.
 *
 * Three surfaces have to be repainted, and only one of them reads CSS:
 *
 *   the chrome    every panel, dialog, button and dock divider is painted from
 *                 `--color-…` custom properties, so setting those on the page
 *                 carries the entire shadcn/dockview surface for free.
 *   the editor    Monaco keeps its own registry of themes by name. It has to be
 *                 told to define the theme and then to switch to it.
 *   the terminals xterm keeps a theme per terminal instance, and this shell
 *                 holds one live terminal per session, all of which have to be
 *                 repainted, not just the one on screen.
 *
 * The last two live in files this module must not import (the editor component
 * is 2000+ lines of Monaco wiring; the terminal factory is the shell's xterm
 * seam). So instead of reaching into them, this module offers a place for them
 * to hand in a function: `registerMonacoApplier` and `registerTerminalApplier`.
 * Whoever registers is called straight away with the theme in force, so a code
 * editor that mounts ten minutes after the theme was picked still comes up in
 * the right colors.
 *
 * Where the colors are written matters. `nextTokens.css` sets the same names on
 * BOTH the shell element and the document root, and a value set on an element
 * beats one inherited from its parent — so writing the theme only on the
 * document root would leave the shell itself on the stylesheet's colors, and
 * writing it only on the shell would leave the menus and dialogs behind (they
 * are moved to the end of the page when they open). This writes both.
