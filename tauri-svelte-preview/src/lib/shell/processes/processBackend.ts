/**
 * processBackend.ts — the one desktop command that stops a running process, and
 * the question that says whether this build of the app has it.
 *
 * Written the same way `worktreesBackend.ts` and `playwrightBackend.ts` are:
 * `@tauri-apps/api/core` is imported only inside the call, and the answer is
 * `null` when we are not running inside the desktop app. `null` means "nothing
 * was invoked" — the card then says the plain truth instead of inventing an
 * outcome.
 *
 * WHY THE APP IS ASKED WHAT IT CAN DO, RATHER THAN JUST TRYING.
 * Stopping a process is not undoable, so the button must never be offered by a
 * screen that cannot actually deliver it. A desktop build made before
 * `kill_process` existed answers the call with an error, and an error arriving
 * AFTER the user confirmed "yes, stop it" is a confirmation they should never
 * have been asked for. So the app is asked outright, once:
 * `read_backend_capabilities` lists what this build supports, and the stop
 * button only becomes live when `processKill` is in that list. A build too old
 * to even have that question answers with an error, which is caught here and
 * read as "it cannot".
