/**
 * playwrightStore.svelte.ts — state for the /next "Playwright processes" card.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CARD IS FOR
 * Playwright leaves processes behind. When a test run or an agent's browser
 * session is interrupted, its Chrome/Chromium windows and its background
 * helpers keep running, and in Activity Monitor they look exactly like the
 * user's own Chrome — same name, same icon. This card lists ONLY the processes
 * the desktop app has positively identified as Playwright's (a Playwright
 * profile folder, or a Playwright script path), grouped the way the operating
 * system groups them, so stopping them is two clicks and cannot touch the
 * user's real browser.
 *
 * Two rules this module exists to enforce (same shape as `contextStore`):
 *
 * 1. **No backend, ever.** Nothing here calls Tauri, fetches, or touches
 *    browser storage. Every backend call lives in `playwrightService.ts` and lands
 *    here as a plain mutation.
 * 2. **No `$effect`.** `$effect` is illegal in a `.svelte.ts` module. Loading is
 *    driven imperatively by the service.
 *
 * Loads carry a monotonic ticket, so a slow first read can never overwrite a
 * fast second one. The import is type-only on purpose: the module stays runnable
 * on its own, which is what `scripts/playwrightStore.test.mjs` compiles.
