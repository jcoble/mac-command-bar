/**
 * playwrightService.ts — the ONLY place the Playwright card talks to the backend.
 *
 * Imperative: nothing here runs from an `$effect`, nothing runs at import, and
 * nothing polls. Reads happen exactly twice:
 *
 *  - the shell calls `activate()` when the Resources panel is opened;
 *  - the user presses refresh on the card, or stops something (a stop always
 *    re-reads, because the stop result lists what was ASKED to stop, not what
 *    survived).
 *
 * Every backend call is counted with `countInvoke('<command name>')` right
 * before it, so the dev invoke counter stays honest.
 *
 * A `null` from a wrapper means "not running in the desktop app" — nothing was
 * invoked. The card says so; it never shows made-up rows.
