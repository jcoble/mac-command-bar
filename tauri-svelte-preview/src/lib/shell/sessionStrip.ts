/**
 * sessionStrip.ts — how the sessions column splits your own work in two, and
 * what is left of it when the column is folded up into a narrow strip.
 *
 * PURE: no store, no DOM, no backend call. Callers hand in the sessions and a
 * Storage-like object, so all of it runs in a node test with no browser.
 *
 * The split lives here rather than in the component because it is a rule, not a
 * drawing: which side a session sits on is the USER's answer (`completedAt`),
 * never the process's. An agent that stopped running is still work in progress
 * until it is marked done, and a session marked done may still have a terminal
 * running.
