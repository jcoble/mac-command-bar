/**
 * panelActivation.ts — when each /next panel is allowed to load its data.
 *
 * PURE: no backend call, no Svelte, no DOM. It only decides *whether* and
 * *with which project* a panel's loader may run; the loaders themselves are
 * handed in (see `shellPanels.ts` for the real ones).
 *
 * The rule the shell is built on is "nothing loads at launch", and there are
 * two different launch noises to keep out:
 *
 * 1. **The center dock announcing a tab.** Building or restoring the tab area
 *    reports an active tab, and that report is indistinguishable from a click.
 *    So tab loads stay switched off until `allowPanelLoads()` is called, which
 *    the page does one timer tick after the frame is ready — every one of
 *    dockview's own announcements is delivered by then (they travel on
 *    microtasks, which all drain before the first timer callback). What the
 *    announcement still does, even switched off, is tell this file the tab is
 *    on screen: the tab loads nothing at launch, and the session picked next is
 *    what points it at a project.
 * 2. **Start-up re-attaching a terminal.** Re-attaching a session that survived
 *    a reload selects it, which looks exactly like the user picking it. So
 *    session loads stay switched off until `allowSessionLoads()` is called,
 *    which the page does when start-up has finished.
 *
 * After that, loading is driven by user actions only: bringing a tab to the
 * front, picking a session, and opening a view of the tool column. A panel that
 * has never been shown never loads, and changing session re-loads only the
 * panels the user has actually opened — and of those, only the ones the change
 * tells something new. A panel is already showing the folder the session you
 * just picked is in when that session shares a project or a checkout with the
 * one you left, and reading it again would throw the panel's work away and
 * rebuild the same answer. So each panel remembers the folder it was last
 * loaded for, and a pick that does not change it loads nothing.
 *
 * Four panels are neither a tab nor always on screen: the **file tree**,
 * **source control**, the **worktree manager** and the **stacks pane**. All four
 * live in the tool column on the right, as views its icon strip switches
 * between, and the shell opens on none of them. So all four follow the same principle
 * by a third route — they load when you can actually see them.
 * Picking a session loads one only while it is in view, and opening one loads it
 * if a session is already picked. Out of view they cost nothing; in view they
 * are never stale.
 *
 * What counts as "in view" is not decided here — the tool column knows both
 * halves of it (which view is open, and whether the pane inside is folded) and
 * reports the answer as one yes or no, per view.
 *
 * The **Problems panel** in the bottom dock has the same route and a harder
 * problem: the dock is on screen from the moment the shell opens, so "in view"
 * cannot mean "mounted" there. `problemsVisible(true)` must only ever be
 * reported from something the user did. Nothing in the shell reports it today —
 * the panel's own Refresh button is the only way in — but the route is here and
 * tested, so the day the dock grows tabs or a fold, one call is all it takes.
