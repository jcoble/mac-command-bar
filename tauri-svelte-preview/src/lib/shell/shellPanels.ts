/**
 * shellPanels.ts — binds the /next panels' loaders to the session rail.
 *
 * The decision of *when* a panel may load lives in `panelActivation.ts` (pure,
 * tested), including the panels that load only while the user can see them,
 * starting with files and source control. This file is the small amount of glue
 * that names the real loaders and reads the current project out of the rail. No
 * backend call is made here: every function below hands off to a lane's own
 * service, which is where the calls are counted.
 *
 * Nothing runs at import — the rail is only read when a loader is about to run.
