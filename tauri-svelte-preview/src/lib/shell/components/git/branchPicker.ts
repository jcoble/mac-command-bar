/**
 * branchPicker.ts — the branch menu's view model.
 *
 * Everything a person can get wrong about branches is decided here rather than
 * in the component: which branch is the current one, what the filter box
 * matches, and whether a typed name is one git will actually accept. The Rust
 * side validates the name again before it runs anything — this copy exists so
 * the reason appears under the box while typing instead of as a failed command.
 *
 * Pure module: no state, no IO, no `$effect`.
