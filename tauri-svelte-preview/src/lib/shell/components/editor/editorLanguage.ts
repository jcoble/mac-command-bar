/**
 * editorLanguage.ts — the last word on "which language is this file?" for the
 * /next editor, for the file types the existing mapping does not know.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * `sourceRecordFromPath.ts` decides a file's language from its extension, and
 * anything it does not recognise comes back as `plain` — which the editor shows
 * with no colouring at all. Its list stops short of a good number of file types
 * the code editor can already highlight perfectly well, and `.sql` was the one
 * that gave it away: SQL files opened as flat grey text even though the editor
 * has had the SQL rules loaded the whole time.
 *
 * So this is a SECOND CHANCE, not a replacement. It is only consulted for files
 * that came back as `plain`, so every file that already opened correctly keeps
 * opening exactly as it did.
 *
 * HONEST BY CONSTRUCTION
 * Every language named here is one the editor actually loads rules for (see the
 * list of grammars imported in `MonacoSourceEditor.svelte`). Claiming a language
 * the editor cannot colour would be worse than plain text: the file would be
 * labelled SQL, or Go, and still show up grey with no hint as to why.
 *
 * PURE: no Svelte, no DOM, no backend — covered by
 * `scripts/explorerFileIcons.test.mjs`.
