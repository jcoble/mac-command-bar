   * hosts must load nothing when it mounts — `ProblemsPanel` reads the language
   * server only when the user presses its Refresh button. See
   * `panelActivation.ts` for the rule and the route that is waiting for a
   * gesture to fire it.
   *

   * buttons write `settings.panels.problemsLocation` and say so, and the shell
   * reacts to the setting. That way the settings dialog and these buttons cannot
   * disagree, and the choice survives a restart.
