/**
 * sessionRowJump.ts — one click from a left-rail row to that session on the
 * exact surface you wanted.
 *
 * Two halves, on purpose. `planSessionRowJump` is a pure mapping from a row and
 * a surface name to the ids the shell has to open, so it can be read and tested
 * without a browser. `sessionRowJump` is the thin dispatch that runs a plan
 * against whichever host is currently registered.
 *
 * There is a host at all because the rail and the surfaces it points at are not
 * siblings: the row lives in the left column, the center tabs are owned by the
 * frame, and the tool column owns its own views. The page is the one place that
 * can reach all three, so it registers itself here — the same shape as
 * `conversation/sessionRestart.ts` and `sessionLibrary/sessionLibraryNavigation.ts`.
