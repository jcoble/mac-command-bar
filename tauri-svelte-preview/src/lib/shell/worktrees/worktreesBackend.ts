/**
 * worktreesBackend.ts — the desktop commands the worktree manager needs, and
 * nothing else.
 *
 * This lane owns its own wrappers (the wave rule for a parallel lane), written
 * the same way `tauriSource.ts` writes its own: import `@tauri-apps/api/core`
 * only inside the call, and answer `null` when we are not running inside the
 * desktop app. `null` means "nothing was invoked" — the pane then says the
 * plain truth about where this data lives instead of inventing any.
 *
 * Three of the five calls already exist in `tauriSource.ts` and are re-used from
 * there. Two do not:
 *
 *  - **removing a worktree the destructive way.** The existing wrapper cannot
 *    send `force`, and this pane's whole point is the button that can. So the
 *    remove is written out here, and `force: true` is put on the wire ONLY when
 *    the caller explicitly asks for it.
 *  - **asking the desktop app what it can do.** An older build of the desktop
 *    app has a `remove_project_worktree` command with no `force` on it at all.
 *    Sending `force: true` to that build does NOT fail: the extra field is
 *    dropped on the way in and an ordinary, careful remove happens instead —
 *    which would refuse, while our screen claimed it had forced. There is no
 *    way to tell those two builds apart from the outcome, so the app is asked
 *    outright: `read_backend_capabilities` lists what this build supports, and
 *    the forced remove is offered only when `worktreeForceRemove` is in that
 *    list. A build too old to even have that command answers with an error,
 *    which is caught here and read as "it cannot".
