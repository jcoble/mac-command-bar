/**
 * worktreeManagerService.ts — every desktop call the worktree manager makes.
 *
 * The rules this file exists to keep, the same ones `gitService.ts` and
 * `contextService.ts` keep:
 *
 *  - **Nothing runs at import, and nothing polls.** The first call happens in
 *    `activate(...)`, which the shell makes when the pane comes into view. A
 *    pane nobody opens costs nothing.
 *  - **No `$effect`.** Reads happen because the user did something: opened the
 *    pane, changed session, pressed Refresh, or finished an action.
 *  - **Every call is counted** with `countInvoke('<command name>')` right
 *    before it, so the dev invoke counter stays honest.
 *  - **No stand-in data.** A `null` from a wrapper means we are not in the
 *    desktop app; the pane then says so and shows nothing.
 *
 * The read is two calls, in order, and the order matters. The worktrees come
 * first because the first record they return IS the repository's main checkout,
 * and that is the folder the summaries have to be asked about: asking about a
 * worktree instead would enumerate the same siblings from the wrong anchor. The
 * summaries are the only place the ahead/behind counts exist, and they are
 * allowed to fail on their own — a row without them shows no remote line, which
 * is honest, rather than taking the whole pane down.
