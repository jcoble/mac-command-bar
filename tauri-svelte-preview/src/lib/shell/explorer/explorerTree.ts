/**
 * explorerTree.ts — the file explorer's PURE view maths.
 *
 * Everything the explorer panel needs to turn "a flat list of scanned files"
 * into "the rows visible in a scrolling tree" lives here: no Svelte, no runes,
 * no backend, no DOM. That is the point — the rune store cannot be loaded by a
 * plain Node test (`$state` is a compiler rune), so every rule worth testing is
 * kept in this file and covered by `scripts/explorerStore.test.mjs`.
 *
 * The tree building, flattening and windowing themselves are NOT reimplemented:
 * they are the audited helpers in `src/lib/sourceData.ts`, imported as-is.
 * This module only composes them and owns the small decisions around them
 * (row height, how far to overscan, which folders a reveal has to open).
