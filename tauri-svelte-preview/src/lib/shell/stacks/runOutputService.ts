/**
 * runOutputService.ts — the live output tail the Run panel shows under a
 * running action.
 *
 * The panel is not a terminal. It shows the last couple of hundred lines a
 * running command printed so a glance answers "is it up yet, and did it
 * complain"; the terminal itself is the session in the rail, one click away.
 *
 * THE DISCIPLINE, same as the rest of this lane: nothing polls. A watch is
 * opened when the panel is on screen and closed the moment it is not. Each
 * watch does exactly one read per running action (its saved scrollback) plus
 * one subscription to the output event that the app is already emitting for the
 * terminals themselves — after that, no backend call happens until the user
 * opens the panel again.
 *
 * WHY IT LOOKS SESSIONS UP. Output events are keyed by the backend's own
 * terminal id, and everything else in this lane is keyed by the shell's
 * `ownedId`. `list_terminal_sessions` reports both, so one read at the start of
 * a watch is enough to translate between them for its lifetime.
