/**
 * stackStore.svelte.ts — Svelte 5 runes state for the /next run configurations.
 *
 * A RUN CONFIGURATION is one saved way to start something: `pnpm dev`,
 * `docker compose up`, `dotnet watch`. On screen that is the only word used.
 *
 * WHY THE CODE STILL SAYS "STACK". Every name in this file — the storage keys,
 * the exported functions, the `script` field — was written when the feature was
 * called a stack, and the keys are what a user's saved data is filed under. A
 * rename here would mean their saved configurations came back empty after an
 * update. So the vocabulary changed where a person can see it and stayed where
 * only the code can: `stack` in this module means "run configuration".
 *
 * The store holds
 *
 *  - the stacks you have saved, per project folder;
 *  - which terminal session each one was last started in — the tag that makes a
 *    session in the rail recognisable as a stack rather than an agent;
 *  - the processes that are listening on a port right now, as last read.
 *
 * THREE RULES this module exists to enforce (same shape as `browserStore` and
 * `contextStore`):
 *
 * 1. **No backend, ever.** The only IO here is localStorage. Every Tauri call
 *    lives in `stackService.ts` and lands here as a plain mutation.
 * 2. **No `$effect`.** It is illegal in a `.svelte.ts` module and against the
 *    shell rules, so saving is an explicit `persist…()` call at the end of every
 *    mutator that changes something worth keeping.
 * 3. **Nothing loads at launch.** The panel is mounted up front and parked
 *    off-screen; `hydrateStacks()` (storage only) and the service's `activate`
 *    are what wake it up when the user first opens the view.
 *
 * WHY THE SESSION TAG LIVES HERE. `OwnedSession` is shared with the whole shell
 * and this lane may not edit it, so "this session is stack X" is kept in this
 * module, keyed by `ownedId`, and saved under this module's own storage key. If
 * the shell later grows a `kind: 'agent' | 'stack'` field, `stackIdForOwnedId`
 * is the one lookup that has to move.
 *
 * WHY PROCESSES ARE MATCHED BY FOLDER. The backend can only see processes that
 * are LISTENING on a port, and it reports the folder each one was started in —
 * never which terminal spawned it. A stack's shell spawns children with their
 * own pids, so a pid comparison would find nothing. So a port counts as this
 * stack's when it was opened in the stack's folder (or a folder underneath it)
 * AND this stack has a terminal that is still running. Two stacks in the SAME
 * folder will therefore both show that folder's ports; the row says "in this
 * folder", not "definitely yours".
 *
 * Imports are type-only on purpose — the module has none at all — which is what
 * lets `scripts/stackStore.test.mjs` compile and exercise it in plain node.
