/**
 * stackService.ts — the ONLY place run configurations talk to the rest of the app.
 *
 * On screen this feature is called "Run" and one saved entry is a "run
 * configuration". In here it is still called a stack, because renaming the
 * functions would mean renaming the storage keys they save under and every
 * user's saved entries would come back empty. See the note at the top of
 * `stackStore.svelte.ts`.
 *
 * Two kinds of outside world, kept apart on purpose:
 *
 * 1. **Reading.** `list_runtime_contexts` tells us which processes are listening
 *    on a port and which folder each was started in. That is the whole of this
 *    lane's backend surface, and it is read at exactly three moments: when the
 *    panel is opened, when the user presses refresh, and when a terminal ends.
 *    NOTHING polls.
 * 2. **Starting and stopping.** Spawning a terminal and killing one belong to the
 *    page — it owns the session rail, the terminal service and the terminal
 *    hosts. So this service does not do either: the page REGISTERS three
 *    handlers here (`registerStackHandlers`), and this service calls them and
 *    keeps the bookkeeping. See `_(stacks)-INTEGRATION.md` for the exact wiring.
 *
 * Every backend call is counted with `countInvoke('<command name>')` right
 * before it, so the dev invoke counter stays honest. A `null` result from a
 * `…FromTauri` wrapper means "not running in the desktop app" — nothing was
 * invoked, and the panel says so rather than showing made-up data.
