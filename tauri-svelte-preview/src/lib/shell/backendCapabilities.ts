/**
 * backendCapabilities.ts — what this build of the desktop app can do.
 *
 * The desktop app answers `read_backend_capabilities` with a list of names. A
 * build too old to have heard of the question, or a browser tab with no desktop
 * app behind it at all, can do none of the new things — so both come back as an
 * empty list rather than an error.
 *
 * WHY A LIST AND NOT A TRY-IT-AND-SEE. Tauri drops fields a command does not
 * declare, so sending a new field to an old build does not fail: it quietly does
 * the old thing. Asking outright is the only way to tell the two apart.
 *
 * The answer is read once and remembered for the life of the page. The desktop
 * app cannot change underneath a running window — a new build means a restart,
 * which means a new page.
