/**
 * gitHistoryFilters.ts — every decision the center-lane Git History view makes
 * before it draws a single row.
 *
 * PURE: no state, no backend, no DOM, no dates. Commits in, rows out, the same
 * way every time — which is why `scripts/gitGraphViewModel.test.mjs` can check
 * all of it in plain Node.
 *
 * WHAT A BRANCH FILTER CAN HONESTLY MEAN HERE. The app reads the history as one
 * flat list of commits, newest first, and branch names only decorate the commit
 * each one currently points at. Nothing in that list says which branch a commit
 * "belongs to" — the question does not have an answer in git either. What does
 * have an answer is reachability: the commit a branch points at, and everything
 * that commit descends from. That is what `gitHistoryBranchScope` works out, and
 * it does it over THE COMMITS THAT ARE LOADED, because those are the only
 * parents we have. Choosing a branch and then loading more history therefore
 * widens the answer, which is correct: more of the line has been read.
 *
 * THE UNCOMMITTED ROW. Work that has not been committed has no author, no hash
 * and no message, so it cannot match an author or a search — a filter on either
 * hides it rather than pretending it matched. A branch filter keeps it, because
 * uncommitted work is on whichever branch is checked out.
