  /**
   * BrowserPanel.svelte — the Browser tab of the right column.
   *
   * The page is not in this document. It is a native child view the shell puts
   * on screen by window-space bounds, which is why this panel spends most of
   * its effort measuring: it hands over the rectangle it wants filled every
   * time that rectangle could have moved — mounting, the panel being resized,
   * the window being resized, and the tab being switched away from and back.
   * When the tab is not the one in front the view is taken off screen entirely,
   * or it would sit over whichever panel replaced it.
   *
   * The page has no width of its own. It is the right column's content, so the
   * column's width IS the page's width: dragging the seam between the center
   * and this column resizes the page, and Widen asks the shell for a wider
   * column rather than stretching a rectangle out over the middle of the app.
   * One width, one seam, and a column that cannot be dragged past the point
   * where the center pane would be squeezed out.
   *
   * Marking up works on a still of the page rather than the live view, for the
   * same reason: nothing in the document can be drawn over a native view. The
   * first tool armed captures the page, hides the view, and puts that picture
   * under the canvas — so what gets marked is exactly what gets sent, and the
   * still stays up until the turn goes or the marks are thrown away. Nothing
   * about the panel's own rows changes while it is up: the still fills the
   * rectangle the page filled, and everything marking needs floats over it.
   *
   * Annotate asks the page what is under the pointer and outlines it. It does
   * that through the metadata inspector rather than the shell's element picker,
   * because the picker needs the live view in front — and a live view in front
   * takes the still, the marks already made and the half-typed sentence off the
   * screen every time another place is pointed at.
   *
   * Marking a place is a numbered thing with words attached, not just ink. Each
   * element picked and each region drawn gets a circle on the picture and a row
   * in the card that floats at the foot of the page, and Send delivers all of
   * it — the sentence, the numbered list, and the marked-up picture — to the
   * session as one turn. It used to stop at the session's draft, and a message
   * staged in a box the reader was not looking at read as a button that did
   * nothing.
