/**
 * annotationList.ts — the numbered things the reader pointed at.
 *
 * Marking up a page produces two different kinds of thing, and they are not
 * interchangeable. A box — an element the picker found, or a region drawn by
 * hand — is a place the reader wants to say something about, so it earns a
 * number, a label, and a row in the list. A freehand line is ink: it says what
 * it says by being where it is, and numbering it would be numbering a
 * scribble. This module holds the boxes, and knows how to put the two back
 * together in the order they have to be painted.
 *
 * The numbers are positions in the list, not identities. Remove the second of
 * three and the third becomes the second, because the badge on the page and
 * the row in the list have to agree with each other and with what the reader
 * counts when they look.
 *
 * PURE: no DOM, no canvas, no Svelte.
