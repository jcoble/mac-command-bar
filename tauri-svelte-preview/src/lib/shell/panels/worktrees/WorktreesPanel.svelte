  /**
   * WorktreesPanel.svelte — the Worktrees tab of the right column.
   *
   * What this panel is FOR: deciding what to do with the folders a repository
   * has scattered around the disk. Every worktree is somebody's unfinished work
   * until proven otherwise, so the panel is built around not losing any.
   *
   * It reads `worktreeManager` and never the machine: nothing loads until the
   * shell calls `worktreeManagerService.activate(...)`, which it does when this
   * tab comes into view, so a cold launch reads no repositories at all.
   *
   * THE ONE THING THAT CHANGED: the panel used to print three commands per
   * worktree for the reader to paste into a terminal, because nothing in the app
   * could be trusted to look before it deleted. Now the two removals start a
   * session in that folder — visible in the sessions list like any other — that
   * reads the worktree, explains what it found, warns about anything that would
   * be lost, and only then acts. The commands did not go away; they became the
   * substance of what that session is told to do.
   *
   * Inspect is the exception, and starts nothing: a whole session in a folder is
   * a lot to set up for a question about facts this panel already has. It hands
   * those facts to the app's small helper model and shows the answer under the
   * row. So an answer here is about what the list last read, not about the
   * folder as it is this second — the removals are the ones that go and look.
   *
   * So this panel removes nothing itself. The one exception is the quiet "clear
   * this entry" on a row whose folder is already gone, which touches no files
   * and still asks first — it used to act on the first click, and on an app
   * build that clears folder-gone rows together it took another row with it,
   * which nobody had been told.
   *
   * The rows themselves are worked out by `worktreeManagerRows.ts` (pure and
   * tested); this file arranges them and nothing else.
