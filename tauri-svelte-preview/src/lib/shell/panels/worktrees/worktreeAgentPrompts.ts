/**
 * worktreeAgentPrompts.ts — what the Worktrees panel's three buttons say.
 *
 * The panel used to print three commands and ask the reader to paste them into
 * a terminal themselves. That was the safe thing to do while nothing in the app
 * could be trusted to look before it deleted. Now the two removal buttons start
 * a session in the worktree and hand it one of these prompts, so the same
 * commands are still the substance — they are just carried by something that
 * reads the folder first and says what it found.
 *
 * The third button, Inspect, starts nothing. Looking at a folder does not need
 * a whole session in it: `worktreeInspectFacts` writes down what this list
 * already knows and the panel asks the app's own small helper model about it,
 * which reads nothing and changes nothing.
 *
 * WHY THE PROMPT IS THE SAFETY MECHANISM: a worktree is somebody's unfinished
 * work until proven otherwise, and the proof lives on disk, not in this list.
 * The list is a snapshot that was read some seconds ago; the session reads the
 * folder as it is now. So both removal prompts are written in the same four
 * steps, in this order, and the order is the whole point:
 *
 *   1. look at the folder, with a command that changes nothing;
 *   2. explain in plain English what is in it;
 *   3. warn about anything that would be lost — changes never committed,
 *      commits never pushed, a branch never merged, a lock somebody set;
 *   4. only then do the thing that was asked, and say exactly what was done.
 *
 * Both say out loud that nothing risky may be deleted without being described
 * first. Neither of them is allowed to be quiet about a loss.
 *
 * PURE: no runes, no DOM, no backend call. Everything comes from the row the
 * panel already built, which is what lets `scripts/worktreeAgentPrompts.test.ts`
 * read every word of these under plain node.
