  /**
   * WorktreeDetail.svelte — what is open under one worktree row.
   *
   * Three parts, and none of them is decided here. The plain facts about the
   * folder come from `worktreeFacts`; the verdict — what to do about this
   * worktree and why — comes from `worktreeSafety.ts` through the row; and the
   * three things that can be done about it come from `worktreeAgentPrompts.ts`.
   *
   * This used to end in three commands printed for the reader to copy into a
   * terminal themselves, because nothing in the app could be trusted to look
   * before it deleted. The same three commands are still what happens — they
   * are just carried now by a session that reads the folder first, says what it
   * found, warns about anything that would be lost, and only then acts. The
   * session shows up in the sessions list like any other, so the work is watched
   * rather than taken on trust.
   *
   * What is on screen at rest is the short answer: the labelled facts, the one
   * sentence saying what this worktree needs, and the three things that can be
   * done about it. The paragraphs behind that answer — why it says what it
   * says, what to check first, and what pressing a button actually starts — sit
   * behind "Why", because a reader who already knows was reading past them
   * every single time a row was opened.
