  /**
   * WorktreeRow.svelte — one worktree in the panel's list.
   *
   * Draws only. Every value it shows was worked out by
   * `worktrees/worktreeManagerRows.ts` and every button hands straight back to
   * the panel; nothing here reads the machine or decides anything.
   *
   * A CLOSED row is one line and stays one line: the branch, the short status
   * words, and the actions. The folder, the age, the remote standing and the
   * sessions live in the open body, where there is room to label them — on the
   * closed row they used to wrap into an unreadable stack in a narrow panel.
   *
   * The row is a kit `ListRow`, so its hover cluster and its focus ring are the
   * same ones every other panel's rows have. Its inset and its text size are
   * set at the foot of this file: the list carries a branch name, its status
   * words and its actions on one line, so it takes the shell's body size and a
   * card's inset rather than the dense sizing a plain file list wants. The
   * actions are the same three the open body offers as words; a person who
   * already knows which one they want should not have to open the row to reach
   * it.
