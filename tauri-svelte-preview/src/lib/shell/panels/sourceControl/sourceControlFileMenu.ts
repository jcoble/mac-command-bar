/**
 * sourceControlFileMenu.ts — the actions one changed file offers.
 *
 * Three that change the repository and five that only read it. Stage, unstage
 * and discard are offered per file because that is how a commit is actually
 * put together: a working copy usually holds two or three unrelated changes,
 * and "Stage All" can only make one commit out of all of them.
 *
 * Which of the three apply is the file's own state: a file with work git has
 * not been told about can be staged, a file with work in the index can be
 * unstaged, and anything with changes at all can have them thrown away. Each
 * action says whether it can run and, when it cannot, why — an item that is off
 * without a reason teaches nothing.
 *
 * Discarding is the one action here that destroys work, so it never runs on
 * being chosen: the panel asks first. Nothing in this file confirms anything.
 *
 * Pure: no DOM, no backend, no clipboard. The panel maps an id onto the real
 * work, so this list can be checked in a plain Node test.
