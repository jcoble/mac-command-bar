/**
 * What a session card in the History panel offers, and what it cannot.

 * This file is pure on purpose: it decides which actions a given session

 * and means the expanded action row and the more-actions menu cannot drift
 * apart — both read this one list.
 *
 * The rule the whole panel follows: an action is either backed by something
 * real or it is off with a plain-English reason. Nothing pretends.
