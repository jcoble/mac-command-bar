/**
 * sourceIntelligence.ts — everything the source editor asks the machine for.
 *
 * The editor knows how to draw code, but it knows nothing about this project:
 * every lookup arrives as a callback prop. This module is the other half — it
 * owns the small amount of
 * context a lookup needs (project root, the file on screen, that file's
 * current text, the scanned file list) and answers each callback.
 *
 * Ported from the old shell's page-local handlers
 * (`src/routes/+page.svelte:8446`, `:8486`, `:8548`, `:8607`, `:10104-10214`)
 * with the constitution's rules applied:
 *
 *  - **One native authority.** The desktop editor gets reference results and
 *    counts only from Roslyn. The browser preview still uses the backend's
 *    plain-text scan because it has no language server. The old shell had a
 *    third tier that answered from bundled demo files; /next never invents
 *    results.
 *  - **Every backend call is counted** with `countInvoke('<command name>')`
 *    immediately before it, so the dev counter tells the truth.
 *  - **Nothing runs on import.** The first backend call of any kind happens
 *    when the user opens a file.
 *
 * WHERE THE "N references" NUMBER COMES FROM (ruled 2026-07-30, replacing the
 * ruling of 2026-07-28 that this comment used to carry).
 *
 * In the desktop app it comes from the language server, progressively and a
 * few symbols at a time. The targets returned while counting are retained for
 * the current file view, so clicking a finished number does not ask the same
 * language-server question a second time and the number agrees with its list.
 *
 * In the browser preview it comes from a plain-text project scan for the
 * current name. A browser has no language server, so this is the fast
 * name-match approximation the old page used before extraction. It is never
 * allowed to populate a native semantic count.
 *
 * The budgets below are load-bearing for both — see
 * `countReferencesForCodeLens`.

/**
 * Turn the C# language server off or on.
 *
 * The C# server is by far the most expensive thing the app starts — around
 * 800MB once it has read a large solution — and a reader who is not writing C#
 * gets nothing back for it. Switching it off keeps the margin counts and the
 * project-wide search working, because those read the files directly; what goes
 * away is the squiggles under mistakes and the precision of go-to-definition on
 * an overloaded name.
 *
 * Call this on start-up with the reader's saved setting as well as when the
 * switch is flipped: the desktop app forgets between launches and starts the
 * server allowed.
