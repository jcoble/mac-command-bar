/**
 * languageIntelligenceBar.svelte.ts — what the editor status bar needs to show the
 * project's language-server controls.
 *
 * The controls live in the editor status bar, but everything
 * they show and everything they do belongs to `EditorPanel.svelte`: it is the
 * panel that asks the desktop app for the server's status, listens for pushed
 * updates, remembers the per-project choice and starts or stops the server.
 *
 * Rules this module exists to enforce:
 *
 * 1. **One owner.** This is a mirror, not a second pipeline. Nothing here
 *    talks to the desktop app or subscribes to anything; the panel publishes
 *    what it already knows and the top strip reads it. Running the status
 *    pipeline twice would double the work this whole design exists to avoid.
 * 2. **Nothing to say means nothing on screen.** With no project open the
 *    strip shows what it always showed, so `hasProject` starts false and goes
 *    back to false when the panel goes away.
