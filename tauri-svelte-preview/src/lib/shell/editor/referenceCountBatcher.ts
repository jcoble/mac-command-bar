/**
 * referenceCountBatcher.ts — how the editor asks "how many references?".
 *
 * There are two different machines that can answer that question, and this
 * module holds the ordering rules for both. Neither makes a backend call and
 * neither holds Svelte state — the caller supplies the way to ask and, in
 * tests, the clock. `sourceIntelligence.ts` wires them up.
 *
 * **The plain-text search over the project.** This is what the browser preview
 * has, and it is all it has: there is no language server behind a page served
 * by the dev server. One pass over the project can count any number of names at
 * once, so asking about each symbol separately would mean reading the whole
 * project once per symbol — which on a large project is what used to lock the
 * app up, and why the counts were simply switched off there. Two rules fix
 * that, and `createReferenceCountBatcher` holds them:
 *
 *  - **One question for all of them.** The first symbol asked about opens a
 *    short window; every symbol asked about while it is open travels in the
 *    same request, and they all get their answer from its result.
 *  - **An answer keeps for a while.** A project-wide count changes when files
 *    elsewhere change, not when the reader types, so answers are kept for a
 *    stretch instead of being thrown away on every keystroke.
 *
 * **The language server.** This is what the desktop app has, and its answer is
 * the better one: it counts the uses of the symbol the reader is looking at
 * rather than every line that happens to contain that word. But it answers
 * about one spot at a time, so nothing can be shared between questions, and a
 * hundred questions fired off together is exactly the storm that made opening a
 * C# file take ten seconds. `createSemanticReferenceCountScheduler` holds the
 * rule that fixes that: only a few questions are allowed to be outstanding at
 * once, they go out in the order the editor asked (which is the order the
 * reader will read them in), and closing the file drops the rest.
 *
 * `createReferenceCountStore` is the one place a counted number is remembered,
 * for either machine. It is filed under the project it was counted in, so
 * moving to another project and back finds the first project's numbers still
 * there instead of counting everything a second time.
