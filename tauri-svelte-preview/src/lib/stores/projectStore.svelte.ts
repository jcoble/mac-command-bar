/**
 * projectStore.svelte.ts — Svelte 5 runes-based "project" data-spine state.
 *
 * Holds the core project STATE: the selected project id, user-added custom
 * project roots, the per-project last-open source path (the files↔project
 * bridge), and the project-keyed scan/index bookkeeping. Extracted from
 * `src/routes/+page.svelte` (master plan, Phase A). Consumers
 * `import { projectStore }` and read/write `projectStore.x`; reads/writes are
 * tracked by Svelte's runes runtime.
 *
 * NAME: exported as `projectStore` (not `project`) on purpose — `project` and
 * `projects` are both pervasive local/param names in `+page.svelte`
 * (`scanProject(project)`, `loadGitRepositorySummaries(projects)`, …), so a short
 * store name would shadow-collide. `projectStore` is collision-free.
 *
 * Pattern mirrors `src/lib/settingsStore.svelte.ts` / `dockLayoutStore.svelte.ts`.
 *
 * SCOPE: values only. All Tauri calls (`validate_project_root`,
 * `list_source_files`, …), every `$effect`, persistence, and the page `$derived`
 * graph STAY in `+page.svelte` and act on `projectStore.*`.
 *
 * NOTE — what deliberately stays page-`$derived` (NOT here): `selectedProject`
 * (the resolved root object) and `projectOptions` (the merged list) are page
 * `$derived` because they depend on the imported `defaultProjectRoots` /
 * `mergeProjectRoots`; and there is no standalone `root` string — the "root" is
 * `selectedProject.path`. Only the underlying `$state` (`selectedID`,
 * `customRoots`, …) lives here; the page derives the rest.
